I've launched an app that matches any colour to popular colour palettes. It's called [Nearest Color](https://nearest-color.com). That site's got demos and videos etc. In short, you give it a colour in any format and it tells you the closest colours to it from your selected palette.

You can [buy it on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nearest-color/id6504228400).

It was made with [Tauri](https://tauri.app) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).
