Do you ever find yourself writing a first draft of something but you keep getting bogged down by making little edits?

**[First Draft](https://first-draft.netlify.app/)** is a text editor I've created that stops editing from slowing you down. It's at **[first-draft.netlify.app](https://first-draft.netlify.app/)**.

With _First Draft_, you can type text. But you can't remove any characters you type.

No deleting. No backspace. No selecting text to overwrite it. No cutting. No replacing text with spellcheck.

It takes a tiny bit of getting used to. But it really helps you get over writer's block and procrastination.

When you've got your typo-ridden first draft out of your brain and onto your computer, copy your text over into another text editor to clean it up.
