I'm making [a new tool called Nearest Color](https://nearest-color.com) to help you find the nearest colour from your palette. It's still a work in progress but I'm sharing progress. It'll be an app for macOS and Windows.

You enter <code>#d58400</code> and select your palette. Say you select Tailwind, it tells you <code>yellow-600</code>. You enter <code>lab(80.5% -40 79)</code>, it tells you <code>lime-400</code>.

I [made a page](https://nearest-color.com/best-color-science) showing how the underlying colour algorithm for Nearest Color finds matches that correspond with human perception unlike other tools that just use the mathematically closest colour.
