3 year ago, I made [a map of British mountains](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1iOCGBdsMcbORzRdTSw7klktqU_5OlKI). The map showed high and *prominent* mountains. Prominence is about how far you have to climb down from the top of the mountain to climb a higher mountain. More prominent mountains are likely to have a better view from the top. The map was meant to make it easier to find those.

Anyway, I made great use of the map on holiday in the Lake District a couple of weeks ago to find good mountains to climb near Keswick. My family and I climbed [Dodd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd_(Lake_District)) (1,410th most prominent peak in Britain) and [Great Mell Fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mell_Fell) (great name, 740th most prominent peak). They both had great views from the top – it works!

We also climbed [Latrigg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrigg) and [Cat Bells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Bells). Those aren't particularly prominent peaks, but are also great walks and views.

Next time we'll have to try [Skiddaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiddaw) (50th most prominent peak) and [Blencathra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blencathra) (200th).
