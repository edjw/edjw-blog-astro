[Save Your Indie High Street](https://saveyourindiehighstreet.uk) is a response to coronavirus.

Local pubs, cafes, restaurants and cinemas have had to close. Even with help from the government, they're under huge financial strain.

Many small businesses sell vouchers or deliver their goods.

Save Your Indie High Street lets anyone submit details about how to order delivery or buy vouchers from small local businesses.

People can then use this information to support their local businesses get through coronavirus.

Nearly 60 businesses are on the site so far. [You can add a business](https://saveyourindiehighstreet.uk/save).

The site is open source. Have a [look at the code](https://github.com/edjw/Save-Your-Indie-High-Street).
