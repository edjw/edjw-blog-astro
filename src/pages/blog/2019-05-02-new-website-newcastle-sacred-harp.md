I made a website for the Newcastle Sacred Harp singing group. It's available at <https://newcastlesacredharp.co.uk>.

The site is built with Jekyll and [the code is on Github](https://github.com/newcastle-shapenote/newcastle-shapenote-website). I learnt to set up Netlify CMS for the site. Which was nice.
