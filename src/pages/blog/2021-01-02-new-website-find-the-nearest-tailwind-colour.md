I've made a new tool called **[Find the nearest Tailwind colour](https://find-nearest-tailwind-colour.netlify.app/)**.

Enter any hex colour code like #FFFFFF and it willl find the nearest colour in [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)'s full colour palette for you.

It's useful when you want to quickly use a colour that's close to another (similar) colour but you don't want to [extend Tailwind's colour palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#extending-the-defaults).

([Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) was handy again here.)

[Take a look at the tool](https://find-nearest-tailwind-colour.netlify.app/).
