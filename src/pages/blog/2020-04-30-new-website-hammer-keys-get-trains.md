### User story

As a 3-year old,

I want to press any and all the keys on my dad's keyboard,

So I can see trains.

### Acceptance criteria

It's done when my son can press any key on a keyboard and see a new train.

### Resulting website

**[Hammer keys. Get trains.](https://hammer-keys-get-trains.netlify.app)**

[See the code for the site on Github](https://github.com/edjw/hammer-keys-get-trains). I used [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/) to learn a bit about that and declarative approaches Javascript.
