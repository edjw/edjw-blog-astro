Title says it all. [Doughnut Reader is my main Hacker News reader](https://doughnut-reader.netlify.com) now. It's got a dark theme, works nicely on mobile, and is really fast. No tracking.

Have a look and let me know what you think.

If you have a look at the code ([source on Github is here](https://github.com/edjw/hacker_news_reader)), you can see that I played for a long time with getting comments to appear on the site in a popup. It kind of worked but I couldn't get the multi-level comments to work well. It means you have to go onto the main HN site if you want to read the comments â€” which, as we all known, is a big if.
