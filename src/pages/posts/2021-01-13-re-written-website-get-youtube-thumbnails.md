A few years ago, I made a tool called Get YouTube Thumbnails. [See my original blog post about it](/blog/2018-08-26-new-website-making-it-easy-to-get-thumbnails-of-youtube-videos).

This is what it did.


> When you submit a YouTube URL, you get back the image, a link to that image, and the original height and width of that image (even if it's scaled down on your screen size).
>
> You can also download the image with a YouTube play logo overlaid on the top.


Anyway, that site broke and I didn't remember enough about how it worked to fix it. So I rebuilt [Get YouTube Thumbnails](https://getyoutubethumbnails.netlify.app)

It does exactly the same thing. It's possibly a bit rough around the edges but it works.

[See the code for the site](https://github.com/edjw/get-youtube-thumbnails-svelte). It uses Svelte and Netlify functions this time around and still uses Cloudinary for the image processing.
