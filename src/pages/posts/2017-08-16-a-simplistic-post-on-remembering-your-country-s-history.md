Donald Trump says that removing statues to Confederate generals is [changing history](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/15/full-text-trump-comments-white-supremacists-alt-left-transcript-241662).

He's wrong.

Take Germany. They don't need statues of Hitler to remember Germany's history even though Hitler is part of German history.

They have memorials to the victims of Nazi Germany instead.

People in Germany remember Germany's history without having monuments of the people responsible for the Holocaust.

America can remember what happened before and during the Civil War without having statues of the leaders of the Confederacy.

They can have memorials to victims of slavery and those who died in the Civil War instead.
