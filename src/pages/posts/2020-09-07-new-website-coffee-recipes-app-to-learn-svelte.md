I've made a very small website of coffee recipes. To be clear, there is [one recipe](https://coffee-coach.netlify.app/v60-by-james-hoffman) on there.

I've called it [Coffee Coach](https://coffee-coach.netlify.app/) â€“ which is way too grandiose.

Basically it just does the calculations for how much coffee or water I need and how much water to pour when I'm making my pourover coffee. There are other bits to a coffee recipe. I haven't mentioned those. This just stops me needing to open my calculator app.

It's been a good way of learning a bit about what [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) can do as reactive UI and app tools.
