This is my now page – it's about what I'm focused on or interested in at the moment.

### Personal
1. Getting ready for my longest run ever – a half marathon around Southampton
2. Learning Spanish with Duolingo (which has got a lot better since I last tried it 10 years ago)
3. Building [Nearest Color](https://nearest-color.com) – finds the nearest colour to a given colour from a colour palette
4. Learning [Laravel](https://laravel.com) – a web framework for PHP
